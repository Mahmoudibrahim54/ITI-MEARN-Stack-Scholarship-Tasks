Payloads 

Registration Form / Login Form 

- username -> 
	XSS & HTML Injection
		Hi, {{username}} -> JavaScript code 
		Hi, <script>alert("heeelllllloooo")</script>  => Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
		Hi, <i><b>Tesssssst</b></i> => HTML Injection 
		
		- Input Validation - Input Santization => Characters & Numbers are only allowed. 
		- Output Encoding -> 
	Cookies -> Session Token Data 
		document.cookie
		document.location 
	
	SQL Injection / NoSQL Injection 
		inject into the input -> SQL Query 
		
		Right Scenario 
		username = admin & password = asd123
		
		SELECT * FROM users WHERE username={username} AND password={password};
		
		return all admin data -> success -> login 
		
		
		Attacking Scenario 
		
		username = admin & password = blaaaaaaaa
		
		Payload 
		username = admin'; 
		
		SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='admin'; AND password=blaaaaaaa;
		
		return all admin data -> success -> login
		
		Password column -> encryption / Hashing 
		
	Remedation / Mitigation 
	- Input Validation 
	- Use Parameterized Inputs/Queries   
	
- password
	- Weak Passwords Policy

Security

- Physical Security
- Network Security 
- OS Security [Windows - Linux - MacOS]
- Application Security 


Sectors interested in Security 

- Finanicial Sector [PCI]
- Medical Sector [HIPAA]
- Software Houses 

Sensitive Data Exposure = Sensitive Data Disclosure 

- Hard coded secret key 
- Source Code 

Finanicial Industry 
- CardHolder Data 
= Card Holder Name
= Card Numer 
= Expiry Date
= CVV

Health Care Industry 
- Patient data 
- Medical records 
- Medical History 


Application Security 
	Application Layers 
		- Frontend
		- Backend
		- DB
		- Hosting Server
-----------------------------------		
Encryption vs Hashing vs Encoding 

Salting 

Obfuscation 

-----------------------------------

Authentication [Who am I]

Something I have – usually a physical token, such as an access card.
Something I know – something that isn’t physical; a secret that only you know about, such as a PIN or password.
Something I am – a biometric, such as a fingerprint, iris, or facial ID.

2-Factor Authentication [Username & Password + Token]
Multi-Factor Authentication 

Vulnerabilities : 
- Session Management Misconfiguration
	- Authentication Bypass
	- Concurrent Sessions -> make sure the user has only one valid session token at the time
	- Token takes a long time to expire -> 
		-> in Banking sector -> expire after 2 mins 
		-> if active, expire after 8 hours 
		-> if idle, expire after 15 mins 
	- Session Fixiation 
	- Missing Password Policy 


JWT -> encoded using Base64 
JWT Signature -> Encryption using specific Algorithm 


UUID => 1235- 52221- 22728 - 2884


JWT token Cracking 
- Weak Key to sign the JWT token 
- No Key to sign the JWT Token [none]


-----------------------------------

Authorization [What can I do]

Vulnerabilities:
- Broken Access Control 
- Authorization Bypass

	= From High-level privilege to low-level privilege
	= From Low-level privilege to High-Level privilege
	= from/to same-level privilege
	
	Change passsword request 
	attacker email + new password -> victim email + new password =>  
	
- Insecure Direct Object References - IDOR
	Change data for user with ID =  55 
	-> within the request , I will change the ID from 55 to 1 
	-> that may cause changing the data of the admin 

Mitigation 
 

-----------------------------------

Insufficient Logging & Monitoring



= Improper Error Handling 

- Reveal sensitive data 
- Debugging mode enabled 
- Show Server Fingerprint
- Show Technologies Version

------------------------------------

Client-Side Vulnerability Vs Server-Side Vulnerability
